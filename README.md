## What is GTP?
GTP is a time-based OTP [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) client.  
time-based OTP is an algorithm implementation defined in the [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).
If you received a secret text from [multi-factor authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) system, GTP is store the secret text on your computer($HOME directory).  
The secret text is secure data, but GTP expects your computer to be used only you.
